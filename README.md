# Portfolio Landing Page

I created this landing page with skills I relearned from [Zero to Mastery](https://zerotomastery.io). While I refresh my skills, I thought it would be nice to start gathering subscribers now, so once my site/blog launches, I'll have an audience to talk to!

## Features

-   Bootstrap 5. I'm more partial to [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) but for the sake of this project I used Bootstrap.
-   I created this neat background with [BGJar](https://bgjar.com/)
-   The "Learn More" button takes you to a Mailchimp landing page so you can sign up and be added to my waitlist.

## What I Learned

-   Bootstrap is less cumbersome than what I remember from previous iterations of it. The fact that it's built with flexbox makes it easier to create a simple, yet responsive layout.
-   I learned that centering with CSS can still be a bit of a pain when you have to set the width of an element. Thank goodness for `margin: 0 auto` right?
